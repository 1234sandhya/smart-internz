This project analyzes Indian Union Budget allocations from FY 2021–22 to FY 2023–24 using Tableau to identify budget trends, ministry-wise and category-wise distributions, and sector-specific funding patterns. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes actual, budgeted, and revised expenditures across multiple ministries and schemes. Data cleaning and preparation were performed, and calculated fields such as total investment, growth percentage, and budget differences were created to enhance analysis. Interactive dashboards and storytelling in Tableau present insights on top schemes, budget growth, and sector priorities, highlighting increased focus on healthcare, infrastructure, renewable energy, and electric vehicles. The Tableau dashboard is integrated into a Flask-based web application for web access. This project supports data-driven decision-making by helping organizations and startups understand government funding priorities and investment opportunities, with scope for future enhancements such as real-time updates, predictive analytics, and cloud deployment.
